This project was undertaken as part of the codecademy full stack engineer career path and served as an opportunity for me to practice:
+ javescript
+ git version control
+ command line
+ developing locally on my computer as oppose to the browser based ide provided by codecademy 

## Technologies Used
Node.js version 16.13.1
prompt-sync version 4.2.0

## Setup
You will need to install Node.js in order to run the script in the terminal.
